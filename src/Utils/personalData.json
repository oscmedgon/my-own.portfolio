      "My career in web development started en 2015 during the second course of my professional education in Seville, where I learned xhtml and css.",
      "Two month later I knew that I wanted to work as web developer at all cost, I studied some new technologies on my own like html5 and css3, but when I did i though, “This it's not good enough.” and I started to study php on my own with some help of my teacher and made two big projects with php.",
      "Some months later my studies finished and started and got a job in my home town, but not related with web development, I did my best to learn all of this new job but two years later my contract ended and I decided to go back to web development and I went to Barcelona to study a bootcamp at Skylab Coders academy, and here I am, this it's the present studying JavaScript, react and much more, but this it's not the end, it's just the beginning."
